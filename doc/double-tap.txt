The functionality mentioned here is a plugin, see |add-plugin|. You can
avoid loading this plugin by setting the "loaded_doubletap" global
variable in your |vimrc| file:
>
    :let g:loaded_doubletap = 1
<
Since you are most likely using some plugin to manage your plugins there is
probably an even easier way.

1 Introduction                                                *doubletap-intro*

In a comment or when making a list in markdown, it's nice to be able to insert
a newline that continues the comment or makes a new list item, but sometimes
that behavior is annoying; sometimes, when you insert a newline from a comment
or a list item, you just want a newline.

This plugin provides a way to handle those situations with a little less
thought: if you've just inserted a comment or list item you don't want, you
can delete it by re-pressing the enter key.

Here's an example with comments, where '|' marks the cursor:

    # This is a dummy comment for the
    # sake of giving an example.|

pressing |<Enter>| will insert a comment, like this:
>
    # This is a dummy comment for the
    # sake of giving an example.
    # |

If you don't want that comment, press |<Enter>| again:

    # This is a dummy comment for the
    # sake of giving an example.
    |

The same holds true for unnumbered markdown lists bullets:

    - This is a list item
    - here's another|

pressing |<Enter>| will insert a list bullet, like this:

    - This is a list item
    - here's another
    - |
      
If you don't want that list bullet, press |<Enter>| again:

    - This is a list item
    - here's another
    |

2 Requirements                                                 *doubletap-reqs*

Double-tap requires |+comments|. It also uses the 'comments' setting,
specifically the part where the {flags} portion is empty, so if you want this
plugin to behave nicely, that should be populated.

I don't really use numbered lists in markdown, nor do they auto-insert for me,
but I could imagine wanting to extend this functionality to that situation. If
you want to do so, feel free to send me a pull request.

Bugs can be reported on the Github page: http://github.com/hneutr/double-tap

This is basically Ã˜ystein Walle's plugin with a tiny change. He's the smart
one. You can find his original version here:
