# Double-tap

fork from [Ã˜ystein Walle](https://github.com/hneutr/double-tap.git) version.
Extends doubletap to work on unnumbered markdown lists.

Sometimes you want `Enter` to insert a comment symbol or list bullet, but
sometimes you don't; this plugin maps a second `Enter` to delete the
comment/list bullet if the line is empty.
